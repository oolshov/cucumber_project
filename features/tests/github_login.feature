Feature: Github Login

Scenario Outline: Login to Github with different accounts
  Given I launch "https://github.com/login"
  When I enter <username> and <password>
  And Click on Sign in button
  #Then I should see title "GitHub" in case login successful
  Then I should see "Incorrect username or password." warning message

  Examples:
    | username |   password   |
    | test     |   password3  |
    | test     |   password4  |
    | test     |   password5  |
